As a result of this, the fake product identifacation using blockchain technology help to verify the product authencity and to store all transactions history. Making more transparent and using cryptographic techniques to enchancing the security and privacy features of the product also.

- Implementing a blockchain based system to know authencity and validation of the product to avoid the replicas of product.

- The goal of the system is to utilization of QR codes and barcodes to facilitate easy and efficient verification and validation of the product. The whole project focus on the detection fake product using blockchain technology.

- Blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology for recording transactions and data .It consists of cryptographically linked blocks, ensuring data integrity. Blockchain enables interactions through consensus mechanisms. Consensus means Agreement and protocols.

- Implementing Smart contracts for secure communication and self executing agreements. And the consumer can scan the QR code or barcode using their smart phones,tablets and any device from anywhere.

- Blockchain handles large data and retrieval of data is easier. Fault tolerance as it is resilent to failures.

-  Ethereum transactions are programmable; can be automatic. Creates ledgers for conditional transactions and beyond. Mining algorithm used by Ethereum is ethash Algorithm.

- By using all features mentioned above the system offers a robust means of ensuring the legitimacy of product and Safeguarding the consumers.

- Customers will be able to obtain and validate product information via QR codes by developing a decentralised application (DApp) with an intuitive graphic user interface (GUI).

- Maintaining a blockchain log of previous transactions will stop unauthorised changes from occurring and ensure transparent and traceable goods movements.

- Identification of fake product using poses a significant threat to consumer's finance,health, safety and repetation of the particular companies.

## Applications

 A fully functional application of fake product identification can effectively reduce the threshold of anti-counterfeit branded products and provide industries with limited funds and a more straightforward approach to provide consumers with confidence and reassurance that they do not buy fake goods, which is unacceptable. All in all, this application based on blockchain technology could prove to be a lifesaver saver for companies and provide a new trading, ordering, and purchasing system that is more secure and friendly. The future operation of the system can be proof of the simplicity of the code, which can indirectly increase the trust of consumers in decentralized applications.

## Importance of Application

- #### To enhance supply chain transparency and traceability

- #### To make sure that every consumer receiving the original product (i.e creating tamper proof record for every product).

- #### To ensure only original products are being sold in market.

- #### Improving traceability of product by recording every detail of product being produced.

- #### To reduce the fake product manufacturers in the market, there by creating an environment free of fake goods.

- #### To provides a user-friendly and efficient method for consumers to verify product authenticity, encouraging them to authenticate products easily.

## The Technology Used in this System

Using blockchain technology for identifying fake products involves a combination of several technological components, including blockchain itself, smart contracts, and often, IoT (Internet of Things) devices or QR codes. Here’s a brief breakdown of how this system works:

- Immutable Record: Blockchain’s primary feature is its immutability. Once data is recorded on a blockchain, it cannot be altered. This makes it a perfect system for recording authentic product data, such as manufacturing details, source materials, and supply chain logistics.
  
-  Unique Identifiers: Each authentic product is given a unique identifier, often in the form of a QR code, NFC tag, or RFID chip. This identifier is linked to the product's record on the blockchain.

- Supply Chain Tracking: From manufacture to sale, every step in the product’s journey can be recorded on the blockchain. This includes details about where it was made, who handled it, where it was stored, and its journey to retail shelves. Each of these steps can be validated by different parties in the supply chain, adding to the product's verifiable history.

- Smart Contracts: These automated, self-executing contracts with the agreement directly written into lines of code can be used to ensure certain criteria are met before a product moves to the next stage in the supply chain. They can automatically verify the authenticity of a product at every step.
  
- Consumer Verification: When a consumer is considering purchasing the product, they can scan the product's unique identifier (e.g., QR code) using a smartphone or another scanning device. This will provide them with the product's entire history, as recorded on the blockchain. If the product is fake, it either won’t have a history on the blockchain, or the information will not match the authentic product's details.

- Decentralization: Since blockchain operates on a decentralized system, no single entity has control over the entire blockchain, making it resistant to tampering.


## Advantages:

-  Transparency: Every stakeholder, from the manufacturer to the end consumer, can view the product's journey.

-  Tamper Proof: Due to blockchain's decentralized and immutable nature, the data is resistant to tampering.

-  Trust: Consumers can trust the authenticity of their products as they can verify the entire journey of the product.

## SOLIDITY

Solidity is a programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and Ethereum-compatible blockchains. 

### Advantages

- Ethereum Ecosystem

The main programming language for Ethereum smart contracts is Solidity. One of the biggest and busiest blockchain ecosystems is that of Ethereum, which has a sizable community of developers, users, and decentralised applications (DApps). The obvious choice for tapping into the Ethereum ecosystem is Solidity.

- Mature and Tested

Solidity has been in use since Ethereum's inception in 2015, making it a mature and well-tested language for smart contract development.

- Wide Adoption

Many blockchain projects and decentralized applications are built on Ethereum, making it one of the most adopted blockchain platforms. As Solidity is the standard language for Ethereum smart contracts, it offers broader potential exposure and use cases.

- Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

Solidity is optimized for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is a critical component of the Ethereum network. EVM compatibility ensures that Solidity contracts can be executed securely and consistently on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Objectives

##### Product validity Assurance:
- By using blockchain to confirm the origin and validity of products, you can be sure that only genuine goods reach the market.

#### Consumer Protection: 
- Protecting consumers from buying fake or counterfeit goods can increase their sense of security and confidence in the goods they are buying.

#### Brand Integrity:
- By actively preventing fake products from entering the market under a brand's name, you can safeguard the reputation and integrity of the company.

#### Supply Chain Transparency:
- By compiling a static record of each item's passage through the supply chain, you can increase supply chain transparency.

#### Quick Verification:
- Give customers the option to rapidly confirm the legitimacy of a product by looking for QR codes or other user-friendly techniques.

#### Reduction of Fraud: 
- Reduce the use of counterfeit goods in fraud, and shield customers and businesses from exploitation.

#### Legal Protection:
- In the event of disagreements or legal actions involving fake goods, give firms legal protection.

## Limitations

- Developing a blockchain-based system can be expensive, and teaching how to use the system can incur additional costs. Another issue is the requirement of technical expertise to create and operate a blockchain-based system. This may require special skills that are difficult to obtain from a company or industry.

- Privacy is also a concern when it comes to blockchain-based product authentication. Although blockchain technology provides a secure and impenetrable record of transactions, data protection remains an issue. Companies must ensure that the information they collect and store complies with all applicable data protection laws.

- Another issue with blockchain-based product authentication is adoption and acceptance. As blockchain technology is still in its infancy, it may not be accepted by some stakeholders, including suppliers, distributors and customers. This may limit the effectiveness of blockchain-based product authentication.
