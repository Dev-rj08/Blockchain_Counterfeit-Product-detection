## FAKE PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION
### Identification of Duplicate/Fake Products Using Blockchain technology

### Software Requirements:

- Front End : [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML),[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)  
- Language : [Solidity 0.8.21](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/)


### Hardware Requirements:

- RAM: Greater than 4 GB
- Processor: I3 and Above

## Description

- Now a days the profileration of fake or counterfeit products in the market has far reaching consequences,keeping the consumer's safety in danger, erode company's reputation and leading to finance lost.So, we have planned to produce this system with the help of blockchain technology to avoid this consequences.

- As a result of this, the fake product identifacation using blockchain technology help to verify the product authencity and to store all transactions history. Making more transparent and using cryptographic techniques to enchancing the security and privacy features of the product also.

- Implementing a blockchain based system to know authencity and validation of the product to avoid the replicas of product.

- The goal of the system is to utilization of QR codes and barcodes to facilitate easy and efficient verification and validation of the product.

- The whole project focus on the detection fake product using blockchain technology.

- Blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology for recording transactions and data .It consists of cryptographically linked blocks, ensuring data integrity.

- Blockchain enables interactions through consensus mechanisms. Consensus means Agreement and protocols.

- Implementing Smart contracts for secure communication and self executing agreements.

- And the consumer can scan the QR code or barcode using their smart phones,tablets and any device from anywhere.

- Blockchain handles large data and retrieval of data is easier. Fault tolerance as it is resilent to failures.

-  Ethereum transactions are programmable; can be automatic. Creates ledgers for conditional transactions and beyond. Mining algorithm used by Ethereum is ethash Algorithm.

- By using all features mentioned above the system offers a robust means of ensuring the legitimacy of product and Safeguarding the consumers.

- Customers will be able to obtain and validate product information via QR codes by developing a decentralised application (DApp) with an intuitive graphic user interface (GUI).

- Maintaining a blockchain log of previous transactions will stop unauthorised changes from occurring and ensure transparent and traceable goods movements.

- Identification of fake product using poses a significant threat to consumer's finance,health, safety and repetation of the particular companies.


## SOLIDITY

Solidity is a programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and Ethereum-compatible blockchains. 

### Advantages

- Ethereum Ecosystem

The main programming language for Ethereum smart contracts is Solidity. One of the biggest and busiest blockchain ecosystems is that of Ethereum, which has a sizable community of developers, users, and decentralised applications (DApps). The obvious choice for tapping into the Ethereum ecosystem is Solidity.

- Mature and Tested

Solidity has been in use since Ethereum's inception in 2015, making it a mature and well-tested language for smart contract development.

- Wide Adoption

Many blockchain projects and decentralized applications are built on Ethereum, making it one of the most adopted blockchain platforms. As Solidity is the standard language for Ethereum smart contracts, it offers broader potential exposure and use cases.

- Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

Solidity is optimized for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is a critical component of the Ethereum network. EVM compatibility ensures that Solidity contracts can be executed securely and consistently on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Applications

A fully functional application of fake product identification can effectively reduce the threshold of anti-counterfeit branded products and provide industries with limited funds and a more straightforward approach to provide consumers with confidence and reassurance that they do not buy fake goods, which is unacceptable. All in all, this application based on blockchain technology could prove to be a lifesaver saver for companies and provide a new trading, ordering, and purchasing system that is more secure and friendly. The future operation of the system can be proof of the simplicity of the code, which can indirectly increase the trust of consumers in decentralized applications

## Limitations

- Developing a blockchain-based system can be expensive, and teaching how to use the system can incur additional costs. Another issue is the requirement of technical expertise to create and operate a blockchain-based system. This may require special skills that are difficult to obtain from a company or industry.

- Privacy is also a concern when it comes to blockchain-based product authentication. Although blockchain technology provides a secure and impenetrable record of transactions, data protection remains an issue. Companies must ensure that the information they collect and store complies with all applicable data protection laws.

- Another issue with blockchain-based product authentication is adoption and acceptance. As blockchain technology is still in its infancy, it may not be accepted by some stakeholders, including suppliers, distributors and customers. This may limit the effectiveness of blockchain-based product authentication.
