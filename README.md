## FAKE PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION
### Identification of Duplicate/Fake Products Using Blockchain technology

### Software Requirements:

- Front End : [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML),[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)  
- Language : [Solidity 0.8.21](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/)


### Hardware Requirements:

- RAM: Greater than 4 GB
- Processor: I3 and Above

### Description

- Now a days the profileration of fake or counterfeit products in the market has far reaching consequences,keeping the consumer's safety in danger, erode company's reputation and leading to finance lost.

- As a result of this the fake product 

- Identification of fake product using poses a significant threat to consumer's finance,health, safety and repetation of the particular companies.


## SOLIDITY LANGUAGE

Solidity is a programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and Ethereum-compatible blockchains. 

### Advantages

- Ethereum Ecosystem

The main programming language for Ethereum smart contracts is Solidity. One of the biggest and busiest blockchain ecosystems is that of Ethereum, which has a sizable community of developers, users, and decentralised applications (DApps). The obvious choice for tapping into the Ethereum ecosystem is Solidity.

- Mature and Tested

Solidity has been in use since Ethereum's inception in 2015, making it a mature and well-tested language for smart contract development.

- Wide Adoption

Many blockchain projects and decentralized applications are built on Ethereum, making it one of the most adopted blockchain platforms. As Solidity is the standard language for Ethereum smart contracts, it offers broader potential exposure and use cases.

- Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

Solidity is optimized for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is a critical component of the Ethereum network. EVM compatibility ensures that Solidity contracts can be executed securely and consistently on the Ethereum blockchain.
