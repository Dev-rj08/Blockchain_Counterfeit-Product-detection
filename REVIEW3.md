## Paper 2

### Current Challenges in Anti-Counterfeiting Supply Chains:
The literature review highlights that existing supply chain systems designed to combat counterfeit goods face challenges due to their reliance on a centralized authority. This centralization introduces issues related to storage, failure, and a vulnerability to single-point processing failures.

### Introduction of Blockchain Technology as a Solution:
Recognizing the limitations of centralized supply chains, the paper suggests that blockchain technology emerges as a potential solution to address these challenges. Blockchain's decentralized and distributed ledger nature can mitigate problems related to storage, reduce the risk of failure, and eliminate the susceptibility to a single point of processing failure.

### Proposal of the Block-Supply Chain:
The primary contribution of the paper is the introduction of the "block-supply chain." This innovative approach utilizes both Near Field Communication (NFC) and blockchain technology to detect and prevent counterfeiting attempts. The proposed block-supply chain aims to replace the traditional centralization with a new consensus protocol designed to strike a balance between security and efficiency.

### Decentralization and Consensus Protocol:
Unlike existing protocols, the block-supply chain is entirely decentralized. This means that there is no single central authority governing the supply chain. Instead, the proposed consensus protocol, unique to block-supply chain, is introduced to manage and validate transactions. This shift towards decentralization is a key feature that contributes to the project's resilience and security.

### Simulations and Performance Evaluation:
The literature review mentions that simulations have been conducted to assess the performance of the proposed block-supply chain. Results indicate that the protocol offers outstanding performance, demonstrating efficiency while maintaining a reasonable level of security. In particular, the paper compares the proposed block-supply chain consensus protocol with the state-of-the-art Tendermint consensus protocol, suggesting its competitiveness in the field.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel approach to combating counterfeit goods by combining NFC and blockchain technology in a decentralized framework, proposing the block-supply chain. The unique consensus protocol of this system aims to address the shortcomings of centralized supply chains while maintaining a high level of security and efficiency, as demonstrated through simulations and comparison with existing protocols.

### METHODOLOGY

The proposed  decentralized system, leveraging Ethereum's blockchain technology, is designed to verify product authenticity and involves key stakeholders such as administrators, manufacturers, and customers. Administrators initiate the process by logging in to validate new manufacturers, ensuring that only legitimate entities can participate. Once manufacturers are verified, they log in to generate unique QR codes for their products and input product details, including certification information. These QR codes act as digital identifiers for each product. Blockchain technology, specifically Ethereum, is employed to securely and immutably store product details and certification data. A Certificate of Quality is issued and stored on the blockchain, providing assurance of product authenticity and quality. Customers can easily verify the legitimacy of the product by scanning QR codes to access detailed information and certificates. The cloud infrastructure hosts the blockchain network, ensuring scalability and availability, with Network Interface Cards facilitating connectivity between devices and the cloud infrastructure.
