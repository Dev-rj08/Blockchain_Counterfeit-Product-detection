# IDENTIFICATION OF THE COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS

## Introduction

- Blockchain-Powered Counterfeit Detection: Counterfeit product identification through blockchain involves utilizing the decentralized and immutable characteristics of a digital ledger, ensuring transaction transparency and security.

- Ensuring Product Authenticity: Businesses leverage blockchain to guarantee the authenticity of their products by creating a digital record of the product's origin and meticulously tracking its journey through the supply chain.

- Immutable Record for Fraud Prevention: Each transaction in the supply chain is recorded on the blockchain, forming an unalterable and transparent history of the product. This serves as a robust tool to verify product authenticity and prevent fraudulent activities.

- Project Benefits and Focus: The project aims to discuss the advantages of this blockchain-based system, emphasizing increased transparency, traceability within the supply chain, and enhanced consumer protection.

- Cosmetic Industry Example: In the cosmetic industry, the platform establishes a digital record for each cosmetic item, detailing its origin, production date, and supply chain information. Through QR code scanning, consumers gain access to a tamper-proof record, tracing the item's journey from farm to table, fostering confidence in product authenticity.

## Literature Review

## Paper 1

### Introduction to the Complex Decision-Making Environment:
The abstract begins by highlighting the complexity of decision-making at the top level, emphasizing the significant responsibility of policy makers and governance systems. Specifically, the focus is on planning safety and security for citizens and consumers concerning counterfeit goods in firms.

### Research Focus on Counterfeiting in Today's Economy:
The primary concern addressed by this research is the pervasive issue of counterfeiting in the contemporary business environment. Counterfeiting poses a threat to both citizens and consumers, and the paper seeks to investigate potential solutions to address this challenge.

### Utilization of Distributed Ledger Technologies, Specifically Blockchain:
The research specifically explores the potential of distributed ledger technologies, with a primary focus on blockchain. It recognizes the unique attributes of blockchain and aims to assess its application potential in combating the problem of counterfeiting within the Indian economy.

### Methodology Employed: SWARA-WASPAS:
The research employs the SWARA (Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis) and WASPAS (Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment) methodology. These methodologies are applied after gathering expert opinions to gain a comprehensive understanding of the counterfeiting problem. SWARA is utilized to evaluate the weights of criteria, while WASPAS is applied to assess and prioritize alternatives.

### Application of SWARA-WASPAS for Prioritization:
The heart of the research lies in the application of the SWARA-WASPAS methodology. Expert opinions and insights are systematically collected and analyzed using SWARA to assign appropriate weights to criteria. Following this, WASPAS is employed to evaluate and prioritize the application of blockchain in different industries, providing a structured and methodical approach to decision-making.

In summary, the research paper addresses the complex decision-making environment surrounding safety and security in the face of counterfeit goods. It specifically focuses on the application potential of blockchain in combating counterfeiting within the Indian economy. The use of the SWARA-WASPAS methodology, guided by expert opinions, contributes to a systematic evaluation and prioritization of blockchain applications across various industries. This research is poised to provide valuable insights into effective decision-making for policymakers and governance systems in the realm of combating counterfeiting.


## Paper 2

### Current Challenges in Anti-Counterfeiting Supply Chains:
The literature review highlights that existing supply chain systems designed to combat counterfeit goods face challenges due to their reliance on a centralized authority. This centralization introduces issues related to storage, failure, and a vulnerability to single-point processing failures.

### Introduction of Blockchain Technology as a Solution:
Recognizing the limitations of centralized supply chains, the paper suggests that blockchain technology emerges as a potential solution to address these challenges. Blockchain's decentralized and distributed ledger nature can mitigate problems related to storage, reduce the risk of failure, and eliminate the susceptibility to a single point of processing failure.

### Proposal of the Block-Supply Chain:
The primary contribution of the paper is the introduction of the "block-supply chain." This innovative approach utilizes both Near Field Communication (NFC) and blockchain technology to detect and prevent counterfeiting attempts. The proposed block-supply chain aims to replace the traditional centralization with a new consensus protocol designed to strike a balance between security and efficiency.

### Decentralization and Consensus Protocol:
Unlike existing protocols, the block-supply chain is entirely decentralized. This means that there is no single central authority governing the supply chain. Instead, the proposed consensus protocol, unique to block-supply chain, is introduced to manage and validate transactions. This shift towards decentralization is a key feature that contributes to the project's resilience and security.

### Simulations and Performance Evaluation:
The literature review mentions that simulations have been conducted to assess the performance of the proposed block-supply chain. Results indicate that the protocol offers outstanding performance, demonstrating efficiency while maintaining a reasonable level of security. In particular, the paper compares the proposed block-supply chain consensus protocol with the state-of-the-art Tendermint consensus protocol, suggesting its competitiveness in the field.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel approach to combating counterfeit goods by combining NFC and blockchain technology in a decentralized framework, proposing the block-supply chain. The unique consensus protocol of this system aims to address the shortcomings of centralized supply chains while maintaining a high level of security and efficiency, as demonstrated through simulations and comparison with existing protocols.
